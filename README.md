# CS-166-DBMS-Final-Project
This final project for CS 166 at University of California, Riverside focuses on a Java-based client with added functionality that allows users to access the Cafe database and perform various tasks.



NOTE: /project/sql/src/load_data.sql has been modified for the various paths to copy data. It will not correctly copy the data into the database unless modified.

The original files are in the /project directory.
The java folder contains the modified code. If you are trying to run the program, replace /project/java with /java.



TO-DO:
- Add necessary functionality/meet basic criteria
- Fix bugs and provide error messages
- Optimize and improve performance (indexing, etc)
- Add a graphical user interface (optional)
